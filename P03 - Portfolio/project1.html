                Throughout the IAT 202 final film I was in charge of audio, lighting and the post production of film editing. I enjoy capturing the fundamental clips on a daily basis, and editing it to form a narration and create certain perspective. The process of the film includes finding actors, scouting locations and establishing the whole film story, which includes storyboard, shot list etc. Th post production of a short film project, has greatly helped me and my group mates to develop the whole story, and helped me personally to create better film content and have a better understand of the film.
