                During IAT 233 I have developed skills in being the modeller of the group. For the final model, we as a team has used Fluidity as our design ethos and created the a model that would go with the art direction. Through out the process we made multiple iterations and sketch models, I was in charge of executing most of the final interior structure and also a part of the exterior structure. Where the curve structures and the elongated designs were done through slicing and bending the materials into shape. This course has really helped me to further develop my understanding towards what I want as a film editor and media creator.
